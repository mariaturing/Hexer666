.summary()

Accessing different layers.

.command()-- full string to build a packet

s=sniff(count=2)
sniff(count=2, prn= lambda p: p.summary())

lsc()
arping()-- which hosts are up

srloop() send 100 packets, plot info in packets

Loadbalancers cheating, information gathering

str() repr(str(pkt))-- binary
hexdump(pkt)-- hex
pkt.show()-- display values
packet.show2()-- computes missing variables
pkt.canvas_dump()

WHAT IS TTL@

ans, unans = traceroute("www.secdev.org", maxttl=15)

ans.world_trace()-- repr of traceroute

You can build a port scanner.19:43

Enough for now! We"ve only got 4 minutes to save the World!
